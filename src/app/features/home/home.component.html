          ello! I'm Jacob Kidd, a passionate software developer dedicated to creating innovative solutions and exploring the world of coding. I specialize in building dynamic and efficient applications using modern technologies like React and NestJS. Currently, I'm channeling my skills into an exciting project‚Äîdeveloping an inventory management system that combines React for a seamless front-end experience with NestJS for a powerful and scalable back-end.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          At present, I work as a Software Developer Intern at Coulee Tech. One of my proudest achievements in this role was developing a fully functional search engine within my first week on the job. The search engine was successfully deployed within that same week, showcasing my ability to quickly adapt, deliver, and contribute meaningfully to the team. In addition to this, I work extensively with technologies such as NestJS, TypeScript, and PHP, alongside React.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          I hold an Associate Degree in Web and Software Development from Western Technical College, where I graduated with a GPA of 3.72. My academic background equipped me with a robust understanding of languages such as JavaScript, Java, and C#, as well as frameworks like Vue and Angular. These experiences have provided me with the knowledge and skills needed to tackle complex development challenges and deliver impactful solutions.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies and keeping up with industry trends. I am driven by a passion for learning and continuous improvement, always seeking opportunities to grow and make a meaningful impact through technology.
